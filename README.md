## Mailgun Email Alert Action
[https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4711/](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4711/)

Adds an alert action to Splunk that allows sending emails via the [Mailgun API](https://www.mailgun.com/email-api).

This is an alternative to the built in email alert action. The main differences are that this sends an email via a HTTP REST call, so it doesn't require a SMTP server to be setup, and it can send HTML emails, instead of just text.
